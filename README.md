# YT_Downloader
- multiple video qualities
- download available subtitles
- convert to mp3

Why will you see a command-line window when you open the app?
- it's because I use yt-dlp library which is cmd based, thus it runs through command-line

- if you copied a video's link from opend playlist it will download the whole playlist. So make sure you copy the link of the video from inside the channel from videos tab
